# [Design](/design.md) â†’ Backing

The purpose of the backing, is to absorb waves that come out of the other end (since the PZT will make a symmetrical wave, and we only want the forward wave).

It needs to do this with minimal reflection (so, no accoustic interfaces; do proper impedance matching).

Casting epoxy + tungsten powder
