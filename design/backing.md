# [Design](/design.md) â†’ Backing

The purpose of the backing, is to absorb waves that come out of the other end (since the PZT will make a symmetrical wave, and we only want the forward wave).

This may not be super important, since we're not doing imaging; but getting a lot of reflections still gives me the heebie-jeebies.

It needs to do this with minimal reflection, meaning you want a material with:
- Same impedence as the PZT-5H (around 32 MRays)
- High attenuation (so it actually absorbs the wave)

A very typical way to do this, is to make tungsten epoxy. Tungsten has a high density, which means it has a high impedence. The more you put in, the higher the impedence.

You can make this yourself, with fine tungsten powder, and low-viscosity epoxy resin. You may also need to rotate it while it cures, since tungsten is heavy and will fall to the bottom.
