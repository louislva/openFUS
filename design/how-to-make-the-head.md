# The Transducer Head

Ingredients:
- 3d-printed **Holder** from `case.FCStd`
- **Lens** - either Silicone Convex made from pouring silicone in 3d printed mold (`lens-convex-silicone.FCStd`), or a PP Concave lens, made by CNC-milling polypropylene into `lens-concave-PP.FCStd` shape.
- **CW2400** silver epoxy tubes
- **Piezo** disc (30x4.2mm from STEMINC)
- **Red wire**
- **Black wire**

Tools:
- A mg scale
- A toxic oven
- (Wire-stripper, if you're not handy)
- Soldering iron + solder
- Latex protective gloves + ventilated, isolated box for working with epoxy (VERY TOXIC)

Instructions:

0. Put on two layers of latex gloves, have prepare kitchen towels nearby, have toxic trash bag nearby.
1. Heat up oven to 60C (highest possible temperature for PLA Holder, lowest possible for CW2400).
2. Strip 1cm of insulation from both ends of the **Red wire** & **Black wire**.
3. Place the **Piezo** disc inside the **Holder**, on top of a **Milligram scale**.
4. Very slowly and carefully pour 1.61g of **CW2400** epoxy and 1.61g of **CW2400** hardener onto the middle of the **Piezo** disc. It's hard to stop at 1.61g, so you often accidentally go a little over - try to correct for this by stopping early!
5. Stir it thoroughly for 2 minutes.
6. Stick the stripped **Red wire** into the hole on the side of the **Holder**.
7. Place the **Lens** on top of the **CW2400**, and press down until the layer is flattened - do not press too hard or long, as this can push it into the creaks between the **Holder** and the **Piezo**/**Lens**.
8. Put it in the oven for 10 minutes.
9. Remove from oven, and let it cool down. Let it harden overnight.
10. Turn it around (with the lens downwards)
11. Add solder to the **Black wire**
12. Place the **Black wire** onto the bottom of the **Piezo** disc, thorugh the hole in the **Holder**, and apply soldering iron to the **Black wire** for a few seconds so it's well attached to the **Piezo** disc. Add a little more solder, if needed.
13. You're done!
